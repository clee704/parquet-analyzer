# TODO

## Near term
- Performance & scalability
  - [ ] Incremental loading: collapsed elements are loaded on demand
- UX enhancements
  - [ ] Better grouping of pages by recognizing ColumnChunkMetadata that appears after pages
  - [ ] Make schema collapsible
  - [ ] Better back button behavior
  - [ ] Go to the top of the element for long collapsible elements
- UI consistency
  - [ ] Add column index to schema view
  - [ ] Consistent style for collapsible elements (schema, row group - use button-like style like columns or segments)
  - [ ] Consistent type printing across sections (print both converted and logical types in all sections)

## Backlog
- [ ] Parsing selected page data
